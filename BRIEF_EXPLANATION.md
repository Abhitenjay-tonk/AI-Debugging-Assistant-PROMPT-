# Brief Explanation of Design Choices

### Why the Wording was Chosen

The prompt is written in a natural, mentor-like style to feel less like a set of strict instructions and more like genuine guidance. The wording is intentionally polite, supportive, and easy to understand, ensuring that students don't feel overwhelmed by technical terms. The goal is to create an encouraging and approachable tone, similar to receiving advice from a senior developer. This helps students feel more comfortable asking for help and makes the learning process less stressful.

### How It Avoids Giving the Solution

The prompt explicitly instructs the AI **not to fix the code** or directly point out the exact bug. Instead, it is directed to provide hints, general guidance, and explanations that nudge the student toward discovering the issue on their own. This approach prevents spoon-feeding answers and ensures the student actively engages with the problem. By doing this, the student learns valuable debugging and logical reasoning skills, which improves their long-term problem-solving ability.

### How It Encourages Helpful, Student-Friendly Feedback

The prompt emphasizes the importance of being polite, simple, and supportive. It encourages the AI to explain *why* the code might not work and to guide students in a way that builds their problem-solving skills. This transforms the AI into a mentor who motivates the learner to think critically instead of just providing shortcuts. It also fosters a more interactive learning experience, as students are encouraged to reflect, test, and try again, rather than passively copying a solution.
