# Reasoning Behind the Prompt Design

### 1. What tone and style should the AI use when responding?

The AI should adopt a **polite, encouraging, and mentor-like tone**. The style should be simple, clear, and easy to understand, avoiding overly technical or complicated language. This ensures that students feel supported and not intimidated, creating a positive learning environment.

### 2. How should the AI balance identifying bugs and guiding the student?

The AI must avoid pointing directly to the exact bug or writing the corrected code. Instead, it should highlight potential areas where issues might exist, explain *why* the code might be failing in general terms, and provide guiding hints. The balance is achieved by encouraging **critical thinking**â€”offering just enough guidance to set the student on the right track, but not so much detail that it replaces their own effort and discovery.

### 3. How would you adapt this prompt for beginner vs. advanced learners?

The prompt can be easily adapted to different skill levels:

* **For Beginners:** The AI should use very simple explanations, break down complex concepts into smaller pieces, and provide step-by-step hints with extra encouragement. The focus would be on foundational concepts and building confidence.
* **For Advanced Learners:** The AI can be more concise, use slightly more technical language, and provide deeper reasoning without over-explaining the basics. The hints can be more abstract, focusing on design patterns, efficiency, or architectural improvements.

This allows the same mentor-style prompt to adjust its depth and complexity based on the learner's needs.
